Student Emergency Response Management System
this project ia about how an institution of higher learning can handle emergency responses from their students. this was the case study of the institution I attended
students could be mugged, robbed or encouter medical emergencies. help usually came late or it was not reported at all. this project therefore helped to manage the
emergencies which could help in faster response and provide data in decision making concerning the patterns of the incidents. the student will be using the web to
sned the SOS which is still a slow way of communicating an emergency. I will be improving the project as time goes by to a mobile app which will make it easier
to send an SOS. I also welcome your reviews, comments, criticts and suggestions to help me develop the best emergency response management system.
I did this project with the least knowledge in PHP then but I will be giving a better improvement in future.
to anyone who gets to see this project, I kindly request you to send even a one word comment or critic of this system
